  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A simple program that takes user input and shows that on the numeric display.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make a timer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we made it count from 0 to 9 and then loop round again.</td>

    <td>The fact that there were not enough GPIO pins meant that we could only have one display (or multiple but showing the same number). We could have done more elaborate things if we had the extra interface.</td>
