    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the booklet and changing bits of the code to, for example: using WASD instead of the number keys to control the robot's joints.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the poor layout of the instruction booklet as it kept on darting between different code snippets and was hard to follow. This was the reason that I had to help many if my peers on this activity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will try out new things instead of only changing a few things in the code copied directly from the booklet.</td>
