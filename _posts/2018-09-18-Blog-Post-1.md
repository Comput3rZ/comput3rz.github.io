  <tr>
    <td>I think the most effective strategy that I used with my partner, was when one of us read out the code to copy and then after all the code was copied up, we would go over the code and what we thought it would do. We would then run the program and see if we were correct. This was rewarding as a strategy and therefore I found it effective.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the factors that limited my learning was that other people were asking me for help on setting up their FUZE box which hindered and interrupted my, and my partners, learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will not fix somebody's problem myself, but point them in the right direction, helping them to learn too.</td>
