    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by tinkering with things in the code and observing the output and how it differs from the one before. This helped me understand what each of the commands do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that two of the three monitors we tried didn't work, meant that we had less time to work on Snake.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time I will focus harder if we have less time to do a task than we would have liked.</td>
